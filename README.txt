# NYC Taxi Fare Prediction

This project develops a predictive model for taxi fares in New York City using machine learning. The notebook includes:

- Detailed analysis and preprocessing of the NYC Taxi dataset.
- Exploration of features relevant to fare prediction.
- Building machine learning models to predict taxi fares.
- Evaluation of model performance using appropriate metrics.

## Files

- `nyc_taxi_fare_prediction.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook with full analysis and model training.
- `Notebook PDF.pdf`: A PDF version of the notebook for easy reference to all plots.
- `README.md`: Overview of the project, including dataset information.

## Dataset

The dataset used includes details about taxi trips in New York City and can be accessed on the NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission's website or Kaggle.

## Note on Interactive Graphs
